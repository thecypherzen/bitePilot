## Overview ###

This **xhrhttp** project is a simple demonstration of how to use the Javascript `XML-HTTPRequest` module to make http requests and handle the responess.

The `XML-HTTPRequest` object is the precursor to the `fetch` and for the sake of undertanding how it works, decided to buid this project.


## Background
The project uses the [json placeholder api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) for demonstration. Results are paginated and displayed on the root route(landing page).

No other route exists on this project so every other request to a route other than the root returns a *404: not-found* page.
